# blender-python
- I have used Blender (https://www.blender.org/) to augment images for training for deep learning based object detection model.
- Using Blender python will be more interesting:
  - if not only for basics such as camera position, rotation and lighting, but also physical simulation is easily performed.
  - **Physical simulation** such as wrapping vinyl, binding cushion (some elastic transformation), reflection, color/tone change, etc...
